Hi! I am <b>Blessing Monday</b> I was born in june 10th 2005. I finished secondary school in 2020 but I am  <br>not that interested towards futhering my education <mark>university level</mark>
which i know i must surely attend. I <br>am from Akwa-ibom State, a village which I don't know about because i haven't spent a long time there. <br>I went there once, i stayed a week which i keep 
insisting in coming back to Port Harcourt (I never liked <br> the place though, but it won't change the fact that I am from there). Ya'll know me as someone from Port <br> Harcourt which is a know i wont
be against. I am a <b>Software Engineer</b> a professional one and I am also <br>going into <b>Web Development</b> Lately. Although I am Science But I love Art too.
